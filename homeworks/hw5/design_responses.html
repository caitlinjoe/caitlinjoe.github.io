                            <p> I learned how important it is to have a good user face. An interactive and easy to use interface makes a user much more inclined to utilize a website. If it's not aesthetically pleasing or difficult to use, many users may be turned away. </p>

                            <p> My favorite part of the article were the interactive designs. Getting to see how different interfaces worked, especially the one for shopping, was very interesting. It also allowed me to gain inspiration. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The shoe shopping interface was my favorite. I liked it best because it looked easy to use and I like being able to test out various colors and designs when shopping. Their interface makes it easy for users to shop online versus in person. I also enjoy how the shoe rotates. </p>
