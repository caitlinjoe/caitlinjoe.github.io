					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that font pairing is just as important as the fonts themselves. Good font pairing helps establish visual hierarchy. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is when they ask us to identify the purpose of our design. I hadn't really thought about what message I'm trying to send across before and instead always focus on aesthetics. I've realized that once you understand the purpose of your design you'll be able to convey your message across more clearly.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Typography is all about experimentation. It's both a science and an art."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
