<em>Junior studying Business Administration</em>
<p>My name is Caitlin and I am currently a junior studying Business at UC Berkeley. I grew up in Diamond Bar, CA and subsequently love participating in outdoor activities. Some of my hobbies include going to the beach, trying new restaurants with friends, and going on hikes. Post grad, I hope to go back to Southern California and work in a strategy role that will allow me to combine by creativity skills alongside my critical thinking abilitites.</p>

    <li>I learned how to be observant about small features in apps and websites that really change the user experience. For instance, the like count button in Twitter is bolded to really catch the user's eye and that's something that I hadn't thought about before but now always notice.</li>
    <li>My favorite part of this article was how it pointed out creative aspects of websites and apps. For example, in the Airbnb app, instead of just prompting the user to search up the destination they have in mind, it suggests "Try London" which gaves the feeling that Airbnb is all about adventures.</li>
    <li>By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself.</li>
    <li>I enjoyed reading this article a lot! 8/10 -- it was interesting and captured the reader's attention since it wasn't too long and had quick takeaways.</li>
