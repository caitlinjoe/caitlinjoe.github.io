<p>My name is Caitlin and I am currently a junior studying Business at UC Berkeley. I grew up in Diamond Bar, CA and subsequently love participating in outdoor activities. Some of my hobbies include going to the beach, trying new restaurants with friends, and going on hikes. Post grad, I hope to go back to Southern California and work in a strategy role that will allow me to combine by creativity skills alongside my critical thinking abilitites.</p>
