					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Pinterest </p>
						</li>
						<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/306565873_772481030648297_2639223160273393149_n.jpg"/>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> Pinterest</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of Pinterest is to get creative inspiration from others. The website doesn't incorporate followers because it's not about the people who post the designs but instead about sharing creative ideas. The design enables people to focus on their feed versus how many people have liked or viewed their images or videos. </p> 
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I wanted to redesign the websight to make it easier for people to find posts that the specifically connected with. The saved button allows users to find what they saved in the past easier versus having to click into your personal profile and then find your saved posts. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
