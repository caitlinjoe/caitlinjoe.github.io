					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of color accessibility especially for those with cognitive disabilities. Ensuring that all people can access content we create is an ethical issue which should be addressed by all companies. By adjusting some colors we use in website design we can enable a wider audience to access out content. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is where they discuss contrast. Contrast is something so simple yet makes a big difference when a person views a website. Contrast affects everyone not just those with cognitive disabilities. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
