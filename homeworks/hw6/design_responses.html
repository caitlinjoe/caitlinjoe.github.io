					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there is an optimal speed for interface animation. These figures are also based on qualities of the human brain due to our attention span being short but also needing time to process what we've seen. Smaller objects should also move faster than bigger objects. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when they included animations to help us visualize what good speed looks like. I also liked the science behind the animation logic. I also liked reading about the standard curve. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users." </p>
						</li>
